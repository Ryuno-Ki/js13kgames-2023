We have been to a train museum today. I'm disappointed that so much revolved
around Amsterdam instead of the town we visited. But okay, capital and kingdom
so I guess the priorities lie elsewhere.

With respect to the code I introduced itineraries to track sailing ships.
By knowing the speed (three to six knots, depending on the wind) and the
distance (I can look at current routes or how the water moves) I can estimate
the time required. I plan to determine the distance in a lookup table and have
seasonal weather so I can round the travel times (at least a month).

The other small change I did was to move supply and demand lists into a new
component. I want to create a dedicated view for a market to have a shopping
interface.

On my agenda is a docks view to load and unload ships. I will need to have a
cargo property as well as weights per ware for this.
I need to rename amount to quantity, too.
