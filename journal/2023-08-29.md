My kid was on sick leave but my wife took the day off. I spent the first half
of the day catching up on sleep (my pensum is waaay too low at the moment, but
the competition is not really to blame here).

I was able to complete the tests in the second half of the day and started some
refactorings afterwards. I think it should build and run successfully but I
want to cover those things with tests and finish the started changes I
introduced while writing tests and documentation.

I also invested some time looking into maritime fonts. Most of them appear to
be commercial, but [Boeticher][boeticher] is a free one I'm going to use to set
the game's title in. Then I have downloaded a SVG of the baltic sea that I will
study and incorporate into my data structure (saving some bytes by omitting
some details along the way).

Finally I researched shantys.
Next to [Drunken Sailor][drunken] there's [Wellerman][wellerman] and several
others. Musescore is a great resource here.
I also fell into a [Wikipedia rabbit hole][shanty] and not only learned about a
new [Metal subgenre][pirate] I've never heard of but also about the type of
work songs. I have to admit that those songs were written way after the
13th century but for the sake of recall I'm considering to include them if they
are under the public domain and have only one voice.

Back in 2020 I've developed some code to [play music][music] roughly based on
[abcnotation][abcnotation]. Browsing that page for shanties yields
[other nuggets][hamburg]. Looking forward to the feedback.
