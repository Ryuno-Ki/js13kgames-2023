A free afternoon in my office! I've got plenty of stuff done. I focused on
those things that I can do without additional material (magazine or Internet).
Next week the school's are re-opening. Until then I want to get more stuff
done because I am going to take care of the kids in the afternoon, I suppose.

I achieved several refactorings today and now sport a warehouse.

I introduced player money and have to study deeper how I want to handle buy and
sell actions. Those were introduced today as well.

I also want to add a way to buy new levels to a warehouse as well as new ships.
