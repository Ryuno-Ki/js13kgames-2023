I introduced some CSS and did research on the history of the Hanseatic League.

In case you were wondering, this is how I subsetted the font:

```sh
pyftsubset "boeticher.regular.otf" --output-file="boeticher.subset.woff2"\
--flavor=woff2\
--unicodes='U+0020,U+0041-0043,U+0045,U+0047,U+004C,U+0068-0069,U+0074-0075
```

In order to have a place to look it up, I'm noting my learnings here:

- Trade with:
  - grains
    - fish
    - salt
    - fur
    - cloth
- Warehouses („Kontor”) had a living area in the ground floor and storage above
  They were tall because the space for buildings became short over time.
- Cologne had a city wall as of 1187 (more than 7 km, twelve gates, 52 towers).
  It was the most important defence construction north of the alps.
- Brunswick had a town hall built by merchants (?) as of 1250
- Hamburg was an important trading centre with defence towers (as of 1310)
- Hanseatic cities such as Dortmund, Magdeburg and Erfurt were often built near
  rivers
- Supported by merchants the Holy Spirit Hospital around 1285 was constructed

More to come.

Then I managed to move the code from my mobile I started a week ago into the
repository. I continued with tests and types on the laptop.

I also noticed and fixed several TypeScript issues and updated the respective
code parts.

All in all a productive day.
