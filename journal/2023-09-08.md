I studied the map further and added more kingdoms. I learned about the
different kinds of governments present at the time. Since I've added cities
I also realised that I need to introduce some islands back to the map. I
researched their name and finaly realised were the old Zealand is located.
It's the island Kopenhages was founded on. For some reason I never realised
that Denmark has so many islands. I always think of it as „place North to
Schleswig-Holstein”. Denmark and Germany share some history and culture.

In fact Denmark played an active part in the development of the Hanseatic
League because the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation did not
care much about what was going on in the North. But I won't be able to make
many more references on history in this game if I want to stay below the size
limit.
