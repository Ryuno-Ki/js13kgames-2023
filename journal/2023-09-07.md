I decided to improve the sea map. Yes, I could remove some points from the
polyline without loosing too much information. But I figured I want to
highlight the political landscape a little by also displaying the kingdoms
that existed during that time. Therefore I added polygons that showed the
kingdoms for those areas that I already had refined the polyline for.
The map I used for the rough outline depicted the situation in the 14th century
so there might be some inaccuracies. I'm also wary that I will receive some
blowback over the omitting of islands and some parts of the coasts. I will
point to the size limitation here. I want to add the cities I mention on the
map as well.

I also coded a little on the go and added a way to show the tutorial part
conditionally. I noticed that there was no way to move between the views
outside of the tutorial so I refactored my components here.
Thinking deeper over it I feel like the city-overview component is no longer
needed. Instead I'm going to use the warehouse as a hub to the other views.
Kind of going back to your own place to coordinate the efforts.
