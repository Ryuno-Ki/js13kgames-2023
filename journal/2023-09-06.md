My plan for today was to implement a map of the Baltic Sea. It turned out to be
more complicated than I anticipated. The image I've downloaded from the
Internet used a path with lots of cubic bezier curves that I had to transform.
My approach is to use direct line-to-line maps. So when I take the current
position and the end position of the curve I can connect the points. Turned out
that the image used implicit positioning to save on commands. Therefore I
started to implement a small parser but gave up short after lunch because it
wasn't obvious whether I would be done by the end of the day. So I looked for
another picture and discovered one using a polyline with points. That one
could be simplified enough to serve my needs.
