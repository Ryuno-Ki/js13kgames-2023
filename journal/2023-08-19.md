Another washing day. This time with actual time to sit down and watching the
clothes dry. I started with implementing the docks.

So there will be a view in which you can load and unload a ship before sending
it to its destination. The idea is to either have wares in the warehouse or
on a ship.

The code contains some bugs, but in general I can move a slider now and have
it update the ship and the warehouse. I take into acvount multiple updates of
the same ware.

I also spend time thinking about the price. Even though it's way more modern
I am going to use market balance as underlying model. Commonly known as
Law of Supply and Demand.

The demand could be raised by investing in sorts of advertisement. Spreading
rumors on upcoming sales or being more present on the market. This kind of
stuff.

I also wondered what ships were common before the cog. Turns out to be Nef
or vikings Knorr. That will suffice for this game.

I wondered how to implement the crew. Each ship is crewed by roughly 12 to 36
people. So if I go minimal I can save money but lack people to row in case the
wind is adverse.
Crew is paid on each arrival for each month they needed. If I raise the pay
they should be more happy. If two or more crews meet at the same harbour at
the same time their happiness level will be equalised.
