I was granted permission to sit down with my handy today to make up for
yesterday. Made great progress!

I'm neglecting the styling for now to be able to click through the interface.

I started with thinking about the data I need to manipulate the most:

- the wares/goods for trading
- cities that buy and sell those
- ships that transport them from one city to another

Next I started to add some interactivity. Allowing one ship to go from one
city to another. Then I figured I want to look at cities without sending ships
that way. It will become important once travel actually takes time.

I realised that I need to restructure parts of my state to make this element
easier to code. Good to notice it early when refactoring is cheap.
