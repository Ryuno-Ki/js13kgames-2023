Today I dedicated time to set up the rudimentary design of the game. I want to
deploy a new version soon, so therefore it should be somewhat appealing.

I almost finished all scenes, except the level, win and game-over ones. My main
goal was to have functioning form elements. And â€¦ I succeeded. Got almost
everything included.

There are some elements that are still on my mind: localStorage (using an
object with the chosen playername as key? I could then allow for loading an old
game state) and document.title (this one will work similar to how I apply
color themes).

I expect to spend a considerable amount of time in the level component.
I realised that I am already around 10k today. There is room for minor
optimisations, but I should really get the game loop complete first.
I might need to sacrifice some visuals or audio to stay within the set
boundaries.

On the professional level, I received bad news. But those belong into a blog
post, not this journal. Check [my blog][blog] if you want to read them once I
published it.
