Today I've set out to add a little of story to the game to make up for the lack
of audio or visual appeal. That required me to turn some components into views.
I need to update the city-overview component to act as a gate to all the other
views. But the views already have a story in terms of tutorial. I don't expect
everyone to read them. The free play won't show the tutorial at all. I will
need to introduce some sort of flag to determine whether I need to display it
but that's for another day.

All in all I'm happy with today's achievements.

I also realised I grew as a person since I joined the Fediverse. I could not
imagine to include a Content Warning in any of my games before.
