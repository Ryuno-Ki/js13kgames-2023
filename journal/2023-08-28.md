It wasn't planned but today I spent a few hours in the library. To my surprise
they had resources on the Hanseatic League!

Granted, their strongest time was in the 14th and 15th century, but the 13th
one was interesting already, too! I'm fascinated by how a loose alliance of
merchants dominated the markets.

The central area was on North Germany with towns like Lübeck. It was a time of
rising populations. That created a demand for international goods. So not only
mass goods like crops, fish and salz but also fine clothing.

It was a time of pirates. And mercenaries to defend against them.
I will need to grab a dictionary to translate the details. My English isn't
good enough for this vocabulary.

In the evening I learned about ESLint introducing a new file format:
[Part 1][part1] and [part 2][part2]. I was able to adjust my config file
accodingly but had to monkeypatch some plugins to make it run.

Now my tests are linted with Standard!

I also installed [XyGrib][xygrib] to read the [GRIB][grib] formats provided by
the [Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie][bsh]
(The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency). Since my system is based on
Debian Linux I have to remember to call it with `XyGrib` (case sensitive).
